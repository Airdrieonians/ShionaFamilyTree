Jane Dryden was born 23/11/1872 in Loanhead - Parish of Lasswade.
Her mother was Elizabeth Dryden - aged 19 (Domestic Servant). 
Jane is classed as (illegitimate). Her mother registered her birth. 
She had a younger sister Georgina who went on to marry two of the 
Liddle brothers: George then Alexander - while Jane went on to 
marry William Liddle. In the 1881 census Jane is living in Loanhead 
with Christina Cunningham her great aunt, a widow, age 58 . 
It is interesting that the census says Jane is Christinaâ€™s 'daughter'.
Jane later adopted the name 'Cunningham' as her middle name and 
named one of her sons John Cunningham Liddle (perhaps after 
John Cunningham her great uncle). 
In the 1891 Census Jane is calling 
herself Jessie Cunningham in spite of having newly married 
William Liddle (27/3/1891) when she was aged 19. 
The names Jane/Jessie/Jean were commonly interchangeable. 
Her occupation at this time was paper mill worker. 
There were a series of paper mills along the valley of the 
north Esk river (including Springfield Paper Mill and Polton Mill). 
She died on 29 July 1920 at the age of 47 from bronchial asthma and 
anaemia. They had seven children in 21 years, with two sets of twins.
