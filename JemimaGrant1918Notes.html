Jemima Ashcroft (known as Mamie) Grant was born on 
18 December 1918 at 5 Panmure Place, Edinburgh, Midlothian. 
Her mother, Jessie Ann (Nan) Grant was 18 and had 
travelled down from Delfur, Morayshire to give birth. 
Nan gave Jemima up for fostering to the Ashcroft family 
of West Calder whilst in Edinburgh. She registered her 
birth on December 31st. Jemima never saw her mother again,
but she knew her name and where she was from. Later in life 
she adopted the name Grant as her middle name, losing the 
name Ashcroft. Her son Dryden Ashcroft Liddle also changed 
his middle name to Grant and she also gave her daughter 
Shiona the middle name Grant. Mamie was proud of her highland 
heritage. Jemima was fostered by the Ashcroft family who lived 
in West Calder. There were already 8 Ashcroft children - 
Mamie was the youngest. At some point the Ashcrofts, who were 
shale miners, moved from Gavieside, West Calder to 67 Sherwood, 
Bonnyrigg. In 1937, aged 18, Mamie married Dryden Liddle 
(aged 23) who was an engineer at MacTaggart Scott in Loanhead. 
Mamie had been a domestic servant in a local house. 
They lived in Loanhead for a few years where they had their 
son Dryden Ashcroft Liddle in 1940. Then they moved to 
254 Colinton Mains Road, Edinburgh. Dryden's older brother George
also lived nearby with his wife Ina and family. In spite of being 
a twin with Archie, George was the brother Dryden kept most in 
touch with. 
Their daughter Shiona was born in Sunderland, County Durham, 
in 1959. In the early 1960s they moved back to Edinburgh to 
6 Camus Road West, Fairmilehead. Then 7 years later they moved to 
St. Andrews to 11 Middleshade Road. At this time Dryden worked at 
John White & Sons in Auchtermuchty as a castings engineer. 
There was another move in the early 1970's to 2 Newmills Road, 
Balerno, Edinburgh, Midlothian. Husband Dryden started a new 
business called Bridgeforth Engineering in Inverkeithing. 
Dryden died of a heart attack while he and Mamie were on holiday 
in Malta. Mamie moved from Balerno to Craiglockhart in Edinburgh. 
Many years later Mamie died in the Western General Hospital, 
Edinburgh on 27 October 2012 at the age of 93. She had a bad 
pneumonia and heart problems. She had lived for 30 years at 
Craiglockhart Terrace Edinburgh, but spent the last 4 weeks 
of her life in Fidra Nursing home, North Berwick where she 
could be near her daughter Shiona.
